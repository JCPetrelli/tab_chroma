# tab-chroma

iTerm2 visual feedback plugin for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Changes your tab color, badge, and title based on what Claude is doing — so you can glance at any tab and know its state at a moment's notice.

| State | Default Color | Meaning |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| working | Blue | Claude is processing |
| done | Green | Ready for your input |
| attention | Orange | Needs your attention |
| permission | Red | Awaiting approval |
| session.start | Reset | New session began |

## Requirements

- macOS with [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI
- Python 3 (standard library only)

## Installation

### Option 1 — curl (recommended)

```

### Option 2 — Homebrew

```bash
brew tap JCPetrelli/tab-chroma https://github.com/JCPetrelli/tab_chroma

## Themes

6 themes are bundled:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| default | Clean blue/green/orange |
| ocean | Calm oceanic palette |
| neon | Vibrant cyberpunk |
| pastel | Gentle, easy on the eyes |
| solarized | Classic Solarized |
| dracula | Dracula editor colors |

```bash
tab-chroma theme list
tab-chroma theme use dracula
tab-chroma theme preview ocean
```

### Theme Rotation

Automatically cycle themes across sessions:

```bash
# Edit ~/.claude/hooks/tab-chroma/config.json
{
  "theme_rotation": ["default", "ocean", "dracula"],
  "theme_rotation_mode": "round-robin"   // or "random"
}
```

## Custom Themes

Create a directory under `~/.claude/hooks/tab-chroma/themes/<name>/` with a `theme.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "name": "mytheme",
  "display_name": "My Theme",
  "description": "Custom color scheme",
  "states": {
    "session.start": { "action": "reset", "label": "Session started" },
    "working":    { "r": 0,   "g": 100, "b": 200, "label": "Working" },
    "done":       { "r": 34,  "g": 180, "b": 80,  "label": "Done" },
    "attention":  { "r": 255, "g": 160, "b": 40,  "label": "Attention" },
    "permission": { "r": 220, "g": 60,  "b": 40,  "label": "Permission" }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

`~/.claude/hooks/tab-chroma/config.json`:

```json
{
  "active_theme": "default",
  "enabled": true,
  "features": {
    "tab_color": true,
    "badge": true,
    "title": true
  },
  "debounce_seconds": 2,
  "theme_rotation": [],
  "theme_rotation_mode": "off"
}
```

## How It Works

tab-chroma registers itself as a Claude Code hook for these events:

| Hook | State |
|------|-------|
| `SessionStart` | session.start — resets tab color |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | working |
| `PreToolUse` | working |
| `PostToolUse` | working — recovers from permission state |
| `Stop` | done |
| `Notification` | attention or permission (based on message) |
| `PermissionRequest` | permission |

### Debouncing

If the same state fires more than once within `debounce_seconds` (default: 2s), subsequent updates are skipped. A typical Claude turn with many tool uses would otherwise send dozens of identical escape sequences, causing unnecessary overhead and visual noise. Debouncing means only the first transition to a state triggers a visual update — subsequent identical events within the window are no-ops.

`permission` and `attention` bypass debouncing entirely and always update immediately, since you never want to miss them.

### Permission recovery

When Claude needs to use a restricted tool, `PermissionRequest` fires and the tab turns red. Once you approve and the tool runs, `PostToolUse` fires and the tab returns to working (blue) automatically — you don't need to do anything.

### Implementation notes

All escape sequences write to `/dev/tty` (not stdout) so Claude Code's hook runner isn't affected. JSON parsing, debouncing, and theme resolution all run in a single `python3` invocation per hook event to minimize subprocess overhead.

## Uninstalling

```bash
tab-chroma uninstall
# or
bash ~/.claude/hooks/tab-chroma/../uninstall.sh
```

For Homebrew installs, also run `brew uninstall tab-chroma`.

## Migration from tab-tint

If you previously used tab-tint, uninstall it first:

```bash
tab-tint uninstall
```

Then install tab-chroma as above.
